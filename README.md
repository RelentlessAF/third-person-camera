# third-person-camera
Tomb Raider/ The Witcher-esque Camera movement for Unity 3D

Code used for a Third-Person Camera in the style of Tomb Raider or The Witcher 3 to be used with a personal game project of mine called The Huntress. If you happen to find your way here feel free to use the code to help you on your game making journey. Who knows how many hours I've struggled to find solutions to my issues and was relieved to find something eventually.
